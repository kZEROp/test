		<p>Predator: Hunting Grounds is an asymmetric multiplayer game developed by Illfonic and published by Sony Interactive Entertainment for PS4 and PC, and it's based on the popular horror franchise. One player controls the Predator while four others control soldiers trying to complete mundane objectives. Yes, this is essentially the Friday the 13th game but based on the Predator cinematic universe instead (it's from the same developer). A full release is scheduled for April 24, but Sony hosted a beta trial weekend from March 27 through Sunday to give players a taste of the game. That taste was quite a bitter one. Anyone who played the beta can tell you the game's first major problem: Queue times are way too long. Illfonic claimed in a tweet that this is a beta-specific issue, but having to wait between 5 and 15 minutes just to play a single match is far too long for any multiplayer game that wants to sustain a player base. Even if this glaring issue is fixed by launch time, Predator: Hunting Grounds still feels terrible to play, especially if you have to play as a regular human soldier and not the Predator.</p>

		<h2>WHO'S HUNTING WHO?</h2>
		<hr />
		<p>The nature of an asymmetrical multiplayer game like Predator: Hunting Grounds is always in balancing power. You’d think that the Predator would have the primary advantage, but somehow that doesn’t always seem to be the case. Rather, the ultimate hunter is little match for a fireteam with even a small amount of cohesion. It all boils down to the trick of sticking together. So long as the fireteam realizes that Predator isn’t much of a match for 4 guns, simply sticking in a tight group is usually enough to all but ensure victory. Predator’s health drains too fast and their healing is too time-consuming to make a real dent in a group that exhibits any coordination. Even Predator’s nastiest tricks aren’t all that powerful. They have an invisibility cloak, but it’s easy to spot if you have any idea of their location. I am regularly able to snipe accurate shots off at a distant Predator hiding in the trees when they’re still cloaking. Worse still for the Predator, all it takes is a few good hits to set them bleeding, which leaves a persistent florescent trail of blood to follow.</p>

		<h2>YOU GOTTA KEEP 'EM SEPARATED</h2>
		<hr />
		<p>The only real path to regular success for Predator lies in hoping for some separation. If a fireteam member strays far enough from the group, it’s no contest. With enough distance the Predator can sufficiently dispatch one soldier before the rest of the group can train their weapons. That said, with few maps and regularly repetitive objectives, most players seem to find the fireteam groove fairly quickly. From then on the game is an uphill battle to say the least when playing in the role of Predator. No doubt there will be those with the dedication to master the role, but overall the balance seems to skew heavily in favour of the fireteam.</p>

		<h2>FIRETEAM OBJECTIVES</h2>
		<hr />
		<p>The unique twist of Predator: Hunting Grounds centers around the fireteam. During each match they take on a series of objectives that actually has little to do with the other side of the 4 v. 1 dynamic. Their initial mission is a hodge podge of tasks revolving around repairing engines, testing water samples, and other busy work. Filling out the gameplay from a combat perspective are a number of NPC soldiers. These provide additional targets to dispose of on your journey, but truthfully provide little resistance. For the most part they filter onto the map via open and obvious lanes that make them feel more like MOBA-style pawns and bullet fodder than intelligent enemies. I like the concept in theory. With mission objective to perform and waves of enemies to worry about, this should create just enough chaos to make the game interesting. It paces the action and I believe the intention is to cause enough distraction to give the Predator a chance to split the squad and eliminate the fireteam one by one. In my experience with Predator: Hunting Grounds however, that generally wasn’t the case. Again, it takes very little coordination for the fireteam to easily dispatch enemies. Furthermore, the few maps and objectives available are so similar, a bit of repetition is all it takes to be able to complete them on auto-pilot. Unless there are some seriously green members of the fireteam, it doesn’t take much cooperative awareness for the Predator’s work to be cut out for them.</p>

		<h2>LOOT IS FOR EVERYONE</h2>
		<hr />
		<p>Like so many competitive shooters, Predator: Hunting Grounds adopts a loot box system for unlocking new aesthetic upgrades. However, in a bit of welcome irony, there’s seemingly nothing “predatory” about it. Players earn loot boxes entirely through in game performance. Furthermore, there are no microtransactions for these whatsoever. In a world rife with such shenanigans, it’s worth pausing to give Predator: Hunting Grounds credit here. It’s actually fun to play and earn new cosmetics, and they unlock at a relativity rewarding pace as well. It’s amazing what loot boxes can do for a game when you remove the microtransactional noose from the equation.</p>

		<h2>SPOT AND PAY ATTENTION TO SPOTS</h2>
		<hr />
		<p>If you can’t communicate via chat, you can use the spotting system to let your teammates know what you see. Whether it’s a health pack hidden, AI enemies, or the Predator jumping through the trees. When everyone can see the threat, it is much easier to act quickly on.</p>

		<h2>CHANGING IT UP</h2>
		<hr />
		<p>Character customization, while available, leaves much to be desired. In terms of aesthetics, you can opt to play as a male or female soldier, though the skin, face, body, and hair options are, frankly, basic and atrocious. You can choose between a male or female Predator as well. It may sound bizarre, but honestly, the female Predator looked more attractive to me as a female player than the human option. I opted for a male character instead for fireteam purposes. There’s a decent amount of options, but they run from olive drab to tan and all the boring colors in between. There are some fun designs like red or blue tiger print, or a particularly fun bloody print that I had to adopt immediately, but most shaders are pretty boring. Luckily, the game makes up for some of these more boring options by giving you fun cowboy hats and gas masks to liven up your look. There’s also a fun skin where your fireteam member can go sleeveless (unlocked at level 100), complete with Predator tattoo, which looked pretty rad. You can either earn customizations by winning matches and opening up Field Lockers, Predator’s version of loot boxes, which contain three items apiece. They cost 500 Veritanium, which is the in-game currency you can earn in matches. So, yes, there are loot crates, but there’s no way to spend real money on anything here. If you buy a Field Locker with Veritanium, you may also get duplicates, which is annoying. But you do get a small amount of currency back if you happen to get something you already had to soften the blow a bit.</p>

		<h2>VERDICT</h2>
		<hr />
		<p>At its best, Predator: Hunting Grounds is a tense asymmetrical shooter that forces you to pay attention to your surroundings in a dense, jungle environment. At its worst, it’s a mess of waiting, loading and gunning down shoddy AI-villains in forgettable missions.</p>
