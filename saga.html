		<p>Senua's Saga: Hellblade 2 was surprisingly announced at the Game Awards 2019 with a heart-pumping reveal trailer. The announcement told us that Hellblade 2 is coming to the next-generation Xbox Series X, as well as PC, but it didn't actually reveal a release date. However, knowing that Xbox Series X isn't releasing until late 2020 (sometime between October and December) tells us that Hellblade 2 won't be about until after that date. It's one of the first confirmed Xbox Series X games, but Microsoft didn't refer to it as a launch title, suggesting it will launch a few months after the new Xbox. That would put Hellblade 2's release date in either December 2020 (we're predicting Series X will release in November 2020) or, quite possibly, in early 2021. </p>

		<h2>Senua's Saga: Hellblade 2 trailers</h2>
		<hr /> 
		<p>Senua's Saga: Hellblade 2 was officially announced for Xbox Series X at the Game Awards 2019, with a peculiar and hard-hitting reveal trailer. While the trailer didn't give much away in terms of story and gameplay, it did confirm that this sequel looks  much darker than its predecessor - which was already pretty dark. What makes this trailer even more impressive is that it was made apparently entirely in-engine on the Xbox Series X.</p>
		<p>Ninja Theory has announced Senua's Saga: Hellblade 2, the follow-up to 2017's Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice. It will be one of the first games to use Microsoft's Smart Delivery technology that gives you access to the best version of the game on whichever system you're playing on, and it's been confirmed that the game will be available on on both Xbox Series X and PC, as is the case with many of Microsoft's exclusives. Hellblade 2 was announced at The Game Awards 2019, with a dark, hard-hitting reveal trailer that didn't give much away in terms of story or gameplay, but did tell us the sequel is coming to the next-generation Xbox and PC - the key part that's still up in the air is the release date. For those who didn't play the first game, Hellblade is a dark action-adventure that follows Senua, a badass Pict warrior struggling with mental health issues that she believes is a curse. In Senua's Sacrifice, Senua travels through Helheim (the Underworld of Norse mythology) in a quest to rescue the soul of her dead lover, Dillion, from the goddess Hela. All the while, battling her own hallucinations and undead warriors who reside there.</p>

		<p>It's been three years since we've traversed the depths of Hel and we're ready to undergo another twisted quest. So we've gathered everything we know so far about Senua's Saga: Hellblade 2 below for your perusal.</p>

		<h2>Senua’s Saga: Hellblade 2 – WHAT IS IT?</h2>
		<hr />
		<p>Senua’s Saga is intended as a direct sequel to Hellblade: Senua’s Sacrifice and will once again feature its heroine battling against an assortment of demons both mental and physical.  It will once again draw inspiration from legends and myths of Norse Mythology for its setting, characters and creatures. We know little about it thus far, although we imagine it will be equally as harrowing as what came before it</p>

		<h2>Senua’s Saga: Hellblade 2 GAMEPLAY – WHAT CAN WE EXPECT?</h2>
		<hr />
		<p>At the time of writing we’ve seen absolutely no gameplay footage for Senua’s Saga, and that will likely remain the case until Microsoft decides to showcase more of its console in the coming months. Chances are – Hellblade 2 will be at the front of the pack once games are in the public eye.  We imagine it will once again be a third-person action adventure with a focus on exploration, combat and puzzles, much like its predecessor. While its narrative and thematic elements were seen as fantastic by many, the gameplay aspects of Hellblade were somewhat under-baked. Combat was repetitive, and movement didn’t possess the weight and presence we would’ve liked. That being said, it was still incredibly immersive thanks to wonderful enviromnents and audio design. Given it now has Microsoft’s financial backing, Hellblade 2: Senua’s Saga will likely be refined in all the right ways. We’re expecting finer visuals, better gameplay and a more complete, experimental story.</p>
