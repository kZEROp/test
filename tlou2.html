        <br/><br/>
        <p>Needless to say, The Last Of Us 2 is Naughty Dog’s biggest project in these few years, players are waiting for it for 7 years, but unfortunately, Naughty Dog has disappointed its players who are excited and willing to wait for it for 7 years. The review of it are mixed now, and it’s review score from its players sunk to 3.4/10 quickly. When compared to media score which has an average of 95/100, there is a huge difference between both sides’ score.</p>

		<br/>
		<h2>And here is why</h2><hr />
        <p>The reason that players are angry at it is most probably the died of the TLOU1 characters, Joel. Joel is the most favourite character in TLOU1, his death makes everyone angry. In the TLOU2, he was killed brutally by a new protagonist, Abby who seeks revenge for her father’s death, and players will have to control her in half of the game. This makes the fans of TLOU1 couldn’t accept it and some even said: “They show a big middle finger to those who loved the first game”.</p>

        <p>Next, some people are angry at the LGBTQ plot of Ellie, although we can know Ellie is an LGBTQ in TLOU1’s DLC, due to the massive positive toward the plot of the main game, there are no much people angry at it. The situation in TLOU2 changed, the most favourite character, Joel died, and her adopted daughter, Ellie became an LGBTQ, this makes some anti-LGBTQ players angry and some of the LGBTQ players also dislike this action that tries to let them satisfy. </p>
		<br/>
		<p>Last, they think there is some illogical part of the story, Ellie killed the guy who told the others not to kill her, but when coming to Abby, who killed Joel and Jesse, shoots Tommy in the head, she spares Abby’s life at the last. The one who saved her, she killed him but turns to the one who killed the one she valued, she spares her life. They think this ending is a bit illogical as the one who is angry and wants to revenge won’t give up the chance for revenge easily.</p>

		<h2>Conclusion</h2><hr />
		<p>In a nutshell, the main reasons that let players angry are the death of Joel, LGBTQ issue and some part of the story that is arguing. The score of it now is back to 5.4/10, how do you think about it? </p>
