        <h2>Star Wars: Squadrons</h2>
		<hr />
		<p>
            Star Wars: Squadrons will let fans of that galaxy far, far away pilot everything from a T-65B X-Wing to a TIE Bomber, and EA has provided a breakdown of each starfighter, their special abilities, how they differ from each other, and the importance of power management between engines, lasers, and shields.</p>

        <h2>How does Star Wars: Squadrons looks like</h2>
		<hr />
		<p>These new details came way by a Star Wars: Squadrons' Pilot Briefing, and it begins by explaining that while each starfighter will have its own unique handling and functionality, every ship will have "primary weapons, countermeasures, a hull outfitting, engines, and two auxiliary abilities (such as missiles or repair droids), though some starfighters also have shields." </p>
		<p>The gameplay appears to be drawing on past games, like the 90s X-Wing and TIE Fighter games, complete with diverting power between ship systems, managing shields, and that first-person view. There are plans for eight pilot-able ships, with a fighter, interceptor, support, and bomber class ship for each faction (specifically, the X-Wing, A-Wing, Y-Wing, U-Wing, TIE Fighter, TIE Interceptor, TIE Bomber, and TIE Reaper fighters.) </p>

        <h3>EA remembers the classics</h3>
		<hr />
		<p>Squadrons makes sense for EA right now because it's not as resource-intensive as making a new Battlefront or Jedi Fallen Order game—hence why it's being sold at a lower price, and why it won't even have microtransactions or DLC. So far, this is the only non-sports game that EA has scheduled for release later this year. According to a Kotaku report from February, Squadrons is one of just two Star Wars games that currently exist at EA, after a spate of cancellations. The other is a Jedi Fallen Order sequel. </p>
        <p>It seems miraculous that Squadrons has made it this far. But this seems like anything but a cash-in. Squadrons has been in development for at least two years. It feels like the perfect marriage of EA listening to fans of older Star Wars games—seemingly never its priority since acquiring the license—and the collective passion of a development team that really wanted to make this specific kind of competitive game.</p>

		<h3>Starfighter Classes - Fighter, Interceptor, Bomber, Support</h3>
		<hr />
		<p>Star Wars: Squadrons features eight starfighters - T-65B X-wing, BTL-A4 Y-wing, RZ-1 A-wing, UT-60D U-wing, TIE fighter, TIE bomber, TIE interceptor, and TIE Reaper, and four classes - Fighter, Interceptor, Bomber, and Support. The Fighter-class (X-wing and TIE fighter) are the most balanced starfighters and are good in most situations, but don't excel at any one thing.</p>
		<p>The Interceptor-class (A-wing and TIE interceptor) are experts at dogfighting and have high speed and powerful lasers. On the flip side, their shields are relatively weak as compared to other classes. The Bomber-class (Y-wing and TIE bomber) are the slowest class, but they can take a ton of damage and can deal even more. They are ideal for bombing runs on capital chips and leading the frontline assault.</p>

		<h2>VERDICT</h2>
		<hr />
		<p>Star Wars: Squadrons is set to be released on Xbox One, PlayStation 4, and PC on October 2nd for $39.99, with cross-play between platforms. EA says you’ll also be able to play through the entire game in VR on PS4 and PC platforms. </p>
