		<p>Forza Horizon 4 retains almost everything that made Forza Horizon 3 the best racer in its class and bakes it into a game that doesn’t ever want you to stop playing. The stunning visual quality and sound design, the massive array of automobiles, and the extensive and completely customisable career mode that have become hallmarks of the Horizon series are all here. What’s new is just how much more effectively Forza Horizon 4 encourages us to return thanks to its shifting seasons, regularly refreshed challenges, and steady stream of rewards. Every real-time week the in-game season will change and bring a whole new look to the world, alongside a bunch of season-specific challenges. Every day there are still more new Forzathon challenges to complete, and every hour there is a live, online event to participate in alongside up to 11 other drivers who we work with cooperatively in order to chip away at a shared goal.Whether the piles of emotes, avatar clothing options, and novelty horns grab your fancy will be a matter of personal preference. As someone who’ll happily wear the same jeans and hoodie for a decade I’m a little numb to fashion, personally, but the GTA Online-style victory dances are pretty cute.</p>

		<h2>'TIS THE SEASON</h2>
		<hr /> 
		<p>Like the previous series entries, Forza Horizon 4 revolves around the fictitious Horizon Festival, a loud and brash youth-focused racing competition. Last time, you played as a Horizon Festival organizer in The Land Down Under; this time out, you live the Horizon lifestyle by dabbling in various festival-related careers in the United Kingdom. The location change facilitates varied weather showcases, and it showcases Forza Horizon 4's new feature, dynamic seasonal effects.</p>
		<img src="gamingpic/forza/forza6.jpg" width="1000" height="550" title="Froza Horizon 4" alt="Froza Horizon 4">
		<p>When you first fire up Forza Horizon 4, the game whisks you through a tutorial that offers a taste of the varied weather conditions. Spring is lush and green, summer is full of sunshine, autumn has beautifully colored leaves, and winter brings icy conditions. The season changes are more than just the application of new graphics; they make the world feel more alive more than any previous Forza game. In Forza Horizon 3, wintry slopes were added as DLC that represented one specific mountain region. In Forza Horizon 4 every track is impacted by the rising and falling temperatures. For example, the scenic lake that you whiz by in the spring, summer, and fall may freeze over in the winter, allowing you to drive over it as an alternate route. Likewise, spring's rain muddies courses, making cornering a chore. The seasons shift every Thursday, so you aren't stuck in one for overly long. In addition, dynamic weather means that you could start a game under sunny skies and see rainfall before you cross the finish line. I initially scoffed at the season effects as just another E3 conference talking point, but when you consider Forza Horizon 4's enormity and how each road is impacted by the changes, the feature is quite impressive.</p>

		<h2>ROAD-PLAYING GAME</h2>
		<hr />
		<p>You unlock seasons by earning Influence, one of the two in-game currencies. The other is gear-centric Credits. The XP-like Influence is earned by entering races, finding cars, and successfully completing challenges. In fact, Influence, along with the new My Horizon Life campaigns and fresh customization features, causes the racer to lean into RPG elements more than ever before. While Forza Horizon 3 focused on expanding the festival, Forza Horizon 4 is a more personal affair. You now progress through the game by exploring more than 25 My Horizon Life story threads. Each of these represents a different way to spend time in the game world, including Road Racing, Drifting, and Stunt Driving. Everything you do in these career campaigns earns Influence, be it nailing stunts, taking photos, or creating sharable car decals or Blueprint race challenges. Even better, you aren't locked into a My Horizon Life campaign; you can jump to a different one at any time.</p>
		<p>In Forza Horizon 3, you build an avatar using a noneditable character model, name, and nickname, but this time out you can customize your character with gear and emotes as you progress through the game. Granted, you still spend the majority of your game time in a car. Need for Speed: The Run this is not, but the personalization adds to the fun times in multiplayer modes where you get to see your character celebrate after a win. Your character is also seen when you interact with NPCs or venture into a house. In Forza Horizon 4, you can buy houses—hubs that act as your avatar's base of operations. They each grant different bonuses, such as cars, fast travel options, and character customization gear. Houses don't come cheap, starting at roughly 200,000 Credits and venturing into the millions. Like Croft Manor in Shadow of the Tomb Raider, there isn't much to do there; you mainly fast-travel and tweak your character and cars. On a less pleasant note, Forza Horizon 4 also has one of the worst examples of product placement that I've ever seen in a game. You can earn Influence by streaming (or viewing others' streams) using Mixer, Microsoft's Twitch competitor. People who stream Forza Horizon 4 on Mixer earn Influence every 2 minutes, with a bonus applied for larger audiences—a huge plus for high-profile streamers like Ninja. In short, the Mixer integration is an odd combination of the virtual and real worlds designed solely to increase Microsoft's footprint in the game streaming space. It's more than a little opportunistic (but not unexpected).</p>

		<h2>SOLO AND MULTIPLAYER MADNESS</h2>
		<hr />
		<p>Forza Horizon 4 is as much an offline game as an online one, but, thankfully, PlayGround Games doesn't force you into matches with strangers. Like Forza Horizon 3, this game uses Drivatars, AI-based competitors that are based on the driving data of the people in your Xbox Friends List, to populate your game world when playing solo. Your Drivatar does the same when it enters your friends' game worlds. You can also team up with Drivatars by rolling up to one, honking your horn, and forming a Convoy. With the right Skill perks, the cars in your Convoy can help you accumulate Influence at a faster rate or discover Barn Finds. Barn Finds are rare cars that you find in barns scattered through the landscape. Some barns are easy to spot, while others require true exploration. Several Barn Finds are only available in certain seasons, so you're encouraged to revisit landscapes as the temperatures change.</p>
		<p>Online multiplayer is far more robust this time around. In fact, PlayGround Games made Forza Horizon 4 a synchronized world, one in which you can can challenge up to 72 other players on your server when in Free Roam mode. Thankfully, all rivals who aren't people in your Xbox Friends List are ghosted to prevent griefing. New to the series are hourly #ForzathonLive online events that group you with others in a session to work toward a combined group score in an activity, such as navigating a Drift Zone or nailing Danger Jumps. The #ForzathonLive events quickly become tedious without the game's other open-world thrills, however. On the upside, you can earn credits in #ForzathonLive that let you purchase exclusive vanity items and emotes from the Forzathon Shop. If you aren't in the mood for #FozathonLive happenings, you can challenge others to standard multiplayer matches or participate in co-op missions.</p>

		<h2>SOUNDWAVE</h2>
		<hr />
		<p>Music plays a large role in the Horizon Festival experience. As you progress, you unlock six radio stations that cover a variety of genres, including classical, hip-hop, house, and indie rock. I lament that I can no longer create a custom radio station (a feature included in Forza Horizon 3 via the Groove music app), but the built-in stations aren't too shabby. In fact, there's a Forza Horizon 4 moment I'll never forget, one that draws a lot of its magic from the in-game radio. There was a moment in when I sped down a lonely road in a black Lambo, in the dead of night, with headlights piercing the dark. I switched stations, and Kendrick Lamar and SZA's "All The Stars" from the Black Panther soundtrack thumped as I rode the British hills under the moonlight. All felt perfect in the world for a few brief moments. That is the Forza Horizon experience.</p>

		<h2>BEAUTY SPOTS</h2>
		<hr />
		<p>Scattered across the map are Beauty Spots, special locations that give you a cinematic view of an area and historical facts.</p>

		<h2>BUY A HOUSE</h2>
		<hr />
		<p>A house serves as your base of operations and comes with perks, such as bonus cars and fast travel across the map. It also lets you see your customizable avatar out in the wild.</p>

		<h2>THE Forza MAP</h2>
		<hr />
		<p>More of the map opens as you complete races and challenges. You aren't pressed to tackle them in any order; in Forza Horizon 4, you determine your story in this open world.</p>	
		<br />

		<h2>VERDICT</h2>
		<hr />
		<p>I’ll always have a massive soft spot for the down under delights of Forza Horizon 3, but open-world racing has never looked as good as it does in Forza Horizon 4. It combines a beautiful world that’s really four hugely distinct maps in one with a constantly rewarding and self-renewing racing experience and I really can’t tear myself away from it. Playground Games hasn’t just upped the ante once again; it’s blown the bloody doors off.</p>
