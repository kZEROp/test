		<h2>Cyberpunk 2077 is delayed to November</h2>
		<hr />
		<p>Cyberpunk 2077 - the highly anticipated open-world RPG — has been delayed again and is moving from its planned September 17th release date to November 19th, developer CD Projekt Red announced today on Twitter. CD Projekt Red says, that it needs the extra time to “go through everything, balance game mechanics, and fix a lot of bugs.”.But hey, don't leave yet, below is the details of the gameplay of the Cyberpunk 2077, you won't want to miss it!</p>

		<h2>Cyberpunk 2077 LIFE PATHS INFLUENCE YOUR STORY</h2>
		<hr />
		<p>When you're building your character in Cyberpunk 2077, no choice may be more important than your life path. This determines who your character was before you join their story in progress. You'll have three options, and each will have a different opening to the game: there's the Corpo, who comes from a life of high-powered suits and executive backstabbing; the Street Kid, who was used to life in the roughest parts of Night City before taking a two-year leave of absence; and the Nomad, who hails from the gangs of roving survivors who travel the wastelands beyond the city. Even once your intro is done, your life path will have smaller impacts throughout the rest of the game - like a Corpo being more comfortable if they ever make it back to a board room. </p>

		<h2>WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT Cyberpunk 2077 CHARACTER CREATION</h2>
		<hr />
		<p>During the 2018 demo, we got a quick peak of the character creation screen. You can customize hair, tattoos, and clothing. It doesn't look like you can change your character's bone structure, though—no deep menu of facial feature sliders here, unless that's changed over the past couple years. The recent hands-on previews revealed more: skin, hair, eye, ear, scar, and tattoo options, plus multiple nipple and penis types and five types of pubic hair.  At E3 2019, quest director Mateusz Tomaszkiewicz explained to Gamasutra that Cyberpunk's character creation won't be limited by gender. "We have put a lot of thought into this. One of the things we want to do in the final game (which we couldn't show in the demo yet, because as you mentioned it's a work in progress) is to give the players as many options of customization in the beginning of the game as we can." You can also change your stats. There are basics like Strength and Intelligence, but also a 'Cool' stat that determines how well you handle stress, which affects weapon accuracy. The full list from what we saw in the demo: Strength, Constitution, Intelligence, Reflexes, Tech, Cool. Notably, there are some important stats from the tabletop Cyberpunk not represented here, like Empathy. You can also change your backstory, referred to as a Lifepath, choosing from Nomad, Corpo or Street Kid, which each have their own origin story and starting location in the world. Each Lifepath unlocks unique dialogue options that can alter how quests play out, so it's an important decision to make early on. However you customize your character, you're still one specific person: V. You're a mercenary, and that's most of what we know so far.</p>

		<h2>WHAT DOES NIGHT CITY LOOK AND FEEL LIKE, AND HOW YOU GET AROUND?</h2>
		<hr />
		<p>Cyberpunk 2077 takes place in the year 2077—which you probably didn’t need us to tell you—and it's set within Night City, a fictional city between San Francisco and LA (as described here) that already exists in the Cyberpunk pen and paper RPG created by Mike Pondsmith. Punks and corporate stooges of all varieties wander these foggy, once Mob-ruled streets, and by 2023, corporations are openly warring for them. Cyberpunk 2077 will show us what happened to the city in the aftermath of that war. Thanks to some awesome crowd technology, the Cyberpunk 2077's Night City feels alive and bustling. In our first demo of the game, it was incredible watching V walk through streets and seeing hundreds of characters walking, playing, talking, and fighting. It's not clear how dynamic this world is, however. We passed by a crime scene in one neighborhood, and we'd like to know whether that crime scene will ever get cleaned up or if it's a static landmark in this area. The city is, by all accounts, massive. It features six districts with no loading screens between them. To help you get around, there are vehicles you can drive in either first or third person. It was hard to get a sense of how realized this part of the game is—we're not sure if there will be all the depth of simulation you see in something like Grand Theft Auto V's driving and traffic. But it did look impressive and smooth. Speaking to VG24/7, CDPR said the autonomous function allows you to summon your car at will, instead of trying to remember where you parked. Let's hope it's better at finding its way than Geralt's horse, Roach. You'll also have access to a garage to store the cars you own, but it's unclear if you'll be able to own them all or if a cap will be set. In a different interview with VG24/7 at E3 2019, lead quest designer Pawel Sasko went into more detail about the districts outside the Badlands. "Players can leave Night City and just explore that area—an area that is mostly sort of destroyed basically after all the droughts and everything that happened in the 50 years from 2020 to '77. And you can explore that, there are specific quests prepared for that, also open-world content, so that’s definitely covered. It’s not only the city that you’re visiting."</p>

		<h2>WILL THERE BE MULTIPLAYER?</h2>
		<hr />
		<p>Yes. CD Projekt officially confirmed that Cyberpunk 2077 will have multiplayer, but the mode won't be introduced until all the free DLC is out the door.This is no surprise, as multiplayer has been teased as a possibility for years now. We first heard about multiplayer features back in 2013, but CD Projekt RED clearly knew the word could agitate its fans. "It will be a story-based RPG experience with amazing single-player playthroughs," reassured managing director Adam Badowski in a 2013 talk with Eurogamer, "but we're going to add multiplayer features."In 2017, CD Projekt CEO Adam Kiciński said that multiplayer features would ensure Cyberpunk's "long-term success," which caused some concerns given the recent kerfuffle over microtransactions.CD Projekt responded to the concerns with a tweet meant to reassure fans that they'll still be getting a Witcher 3-style singleplayer story. "Worry not," it said. "When thinking CP2077, think nothing less than TW3—huge single player, open world, story-driven RPG. No hidden catch, you get what you pay for—no bullshit, just honest gaming like with Wild Hunt."</p>
