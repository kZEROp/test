        <h2>Valorant </h2>
		<hr />
		<p>Think Counter-Strike with hero elements. That's the elevator pitch for Valorant, Riot Games' debut on the competitive first-person shooter scene. I say that not to disparage Valorant, though. In fact, that's what I love most about it, especially since it executes on the formula extremely well. Valorant thrives because of tight, tactical gameplay and a mix of character-based abilities that provide a necessary strategic layer. Although it's a slim package with limited features and barren presentation, Valorant has the potential to be great.</p>

        <h2>How does valorant looks like</h2>
		<hr />
		<p>The core mode of Valorant revolves around five-on-five matches in a best of 25 rounds with two teams of attackers and defenders of bomb sites, switching sides about halfway through. The stakes are high as everyone gets only one life per round, and the focus on precise gunplay with low time-to-kill leaves little margin for error. Teams must account for buying guns, armor, and ability charges based on money allocated (depending on performance) on a per-round basis. In turn, each round maintains a high level of intensity as the tide of advantage can shift at any moment.</p>
		<p>Agents introduce an essential X-factor to the mix with their unique abilities as well. While it's easy to compare them to heroes/classes from other games, Valorant's Agent abilities function more like gear in a loadout. Two are subject to limited uses per round (but thankfully carry over even if you're killed) while a default ability subject to cooldown or replenish upon kills. Knowing how and when to execute these abilities, including Ultimates that can come in clutch, is key especially for highly competitive matches. </p>

        <h3>Aim training</h3>
		<hr />
		<p>Players who haven't spent triple-digit hours in Counter-Strike might find Valorant's shooting a significant hurdle. Remembering to stand still before shooting is an ongoing adjustment for me, but the practice arena has plenty of useful tools for training your aim and tuning sensitivity. Valorant's exaggerated bullet tracers make it easy to track shots midair and react to recoil on-the-fly. Other intrinsic CS mechanics, like the weapon economy and Buy Phase, feel under-explained. Valorant will undoubtedly attract people who haven't touched CS, and it lacks onboarding for basic strategies like save rounds, playing for picks, and bomb placement. </p>

		<h3>Map talk</h3>
		<hr />
		<p>The only area where Valorant feels a bit shallow at launch is its map pool. There are four maps at launch. It's slim pickings, but I appreciate the variety in layout and style. Riot says it wants each map to feature something  "new and unique"—Bind has portals that connect the two sites, Haven's mid is a third bomb site, Split has climbing ropes, and Ascent (the new map for launch) has one-way metal doors.</p>
		<p>For the most part, Valorant's map design succeeds at replicating Counter-Strike's carefully considered sightlines and chokepoints. You can't pick and choose which maps to queue for in matchmaking, so it's all the more important that no maps stand out as completely one-sided. The more gimmicky stuff mostly works, though Split's ropes feel inconsequential and Bind's portals can cause more trouble than they're worth. It'll take months for the community to fully evaluate each map's strengths and weaknesses, but I'm having fun wherever I end up. Having a brand new map to learn has squashed the fatigue I was feeling playing the same three maps during closed beta. </p>

		<h2>VERDICT</h2>
		<hr />
		<p>Valorant transforms the best of CS:GO with agents and abilities, resulting in an exceptional FPS that everyone should try.</p>
