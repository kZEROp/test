		<p>Turbulent 2020 be damned, Marvel's Avengers is still on track to release this year. The new Avengers is a third-person co-op action game from Tomb Raider studio Crystal Dynamics. Similar to Sony's PS4 game, Marvel's Avengers doesn't actually fit in with the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Instead, Crystal Dynamics is telling a story that branches off from the MCU and tells an original story. With coronavirus-related delays for Black Widow and other future Marvel films, though, this is the main Avengers action we can expect in 2020. This is the first part of what's described as a "multi-year, multi-game partnership" between Square Enix and Marvel. Avengers won't be the only Marvel game you'll see from Square Enix, then, but it's the one we know about right now, so let's dig in.</p>

		<h2>WHEN IS Marvel's Avengers COMING OUT?</h2>
		<hr />
		<p>Marvel's Avengers will launch on September 4th, 2020 for PC, PS4, Xbox One. Square Enix originally planned a May 2020 release but the spinoff was pushed back, as have been so many games this year, due to the pressures of the Covid-19 coronavirus pandemic. </p>

		<h2>WHO'S DEVELOPING Marvel's Avengers GAMES?</h2>
		<hr />
		<p>Crystal Dynamics, creators of Tomb Raider, with Eidos Montreal (creators of the last two Deus Ex games), Crystal Northwest, and Nexxes Software. Considering the game has big plans for post-launch content and multiplayer, it makes sense that so many hands are on deck to make Avengers work.</p>

		<h2>WHAT KIND OF GAME WILL Marvel's Avengers BE?</h2>
		<hr />
		<p>After the E3 2019 reveal, we have a good idea of the kind of game Marvel's Avengers will be: a continuously singleplayer and co-op 3rd person 'action-adventure' game, with what sound like a few RPG elements. You can "master extraordinary abilities, customize your heroes to fit your playstyle, and combine powers", after all, which all sound kind of RPG-ish. We also know that you can unlock "powerful skills and new gear to build your ideal version of Earth’s Mightiest Heroes." Mention is also made of an 'ever-expanding world under constant threat'. So yes, Marvel's Avengers will be a frequently updated live service game.</p>

		<h2>Marvel's Avengers: THE STORY</h2>
		<hr />
		<p>Speaking of which, you may want to get an idea of the narrative behind Marvel's Avengers. The game does not take place in the Marvel Cinematic Universe -- it instead draws inspiration from the long line of Marvel comic books. The story starts on A-Day, a celebration which sees five founding members of the Avengers (Captain America, Iron Man, Thor, Black Widow, and Bruce Banner) unveiling a new headquarters in the city of San Francisco as well as a Helicarrier powered by a Terrigen Crystal. However, as the event progresses, a terrorist organisation led by villain Taskmaster attacks the Golden Gate Bridge and the surrounding area. This results in the death of Captain America. The Avengers are blamed for the attack, and five years later, San Francisco finds itself under the control of A.I.M with superhero stature outlawed. At the same time, Kamala Khan learns of her own superpowers as well as a conspiracy regarding the evil, aforementioned corporation. She then takes it on herself to reassemble the Avengers and bring about justice. In the June 2020 Marvel's Avengers trailer, it is confirmed that M.O.D.O.K. (Mental Organism Designed Only for Killing) will be one of the game's main villains alongside the Abomination and Taskmaster.</p>

		<h2>Marvel's Avengers: GAMEPLAY AND ABILITIES</h2>
		<hr />
		<p>Marvel's Avengers is a third-person action experience that will allow you to customise your roster of superheroes with new abilities, skills, and upgrades. Multiple skill trees for each character give you the chance to make each superhero your own with various movesets to utilise during combat, from simple light and heavy attacks right the way through to ultimate abilities. Thor, for example, can be customised using four different upgrade paths -- Melee, Ranged, Intrinsic Ability, and Intrinsic Overcharge. Heroic Moves can also be taken advantage of during combat, with each superhero gaining access to three. Split up into categories of Assault, Ultimate, and Support, these special attacks can turn the tides of battle in your favour if activated at the right time. The Assault and Ultimate abilities are fairly self-explanatory, but it's the Support move which charges up your teammates during co-op play. All of these attacks are governed by a meter which is powered by performing basic light and heavy moves.</p>

		<h2>Marvel's Avengers: CUSTOMISATION AND LOOT</h2>
		<hr />
		<p>Alongside customisation of your gameplay abilities, Marvel's Avengers also allows you to switch up the look of each playable character through loot and cosmetic items. You can modify pieces of equipment to accommodate for bonuses and perks alongside obvious stat boosts. Think of Destiny 2's loot system and you've got the right idea. Rarity tiers will make better pieces of gear more obvious to the player while completing a certain set will grant extra perks on top of the basic stat rolls each piece of gear comes with. On top of that, Marvel's Avengers will ship with cosmetic costumes that harken back to numerous moments in comic book history. Some of these will be purchasable through an online store, but Crystal Dynamics has promised that it will never integrate pay-to-win mechanics. You'll also be able to earn certain outfits by simply playing the game.</p>

		<h2>OVERALL THOUGHTS ON Marvel’s Avengers GAMEPLAY</h2>
		<hr />
		<p>Though we still haven’t gotten to play ourselves, Marvel’s Avengers definitely looks like it will deliver when it comes to living out the fantasy of fighting evil as the most iconic Avengers. You get to do all the coolest moves and witness as they are executed in stunning cinematic fashion. While the graphics during combat were pristine, the brief cutscenes didn’t seem as polished -- Thor’s hair looks especially strange when it’s blowing in the wind -- and the team banter wasn’t especially funny or memorable. Thor, in particular, sticks out like a sore thumb because he very much speaks in the original Chris Hemsworth cadence from before the engaging and hilarious Ragnarok reinvention of the character. Although, this is of course a demo of a still-in-progress game that won’t be released for almost a year, so in theory there’s still plenty of time for some of these things to get smoothed over. While Thor, Hulk and Iron Man were each distinct enough that they almost felt like characters from entirely different games, Cap and Widow were, understandably, a bit similar in feel given they’re all about melee combat with no eye-popping super powers to speak of. Still, it was an eventful good time watching the Avengers respond to a supervillain attack and do what they do best. No insight was given on what kind of game this will be beyond the demo, so we’ll have to wait and see for details on what progression, customization, and other elements will look like. But as far as this demo is concerned, the initial gameplay looks solid despite some obvious shortcomings.</p>

		<h2>EARLY VERDICT</h2>
		<hr />
		<p>While some polishing is definitely needed, Marvel's Avengers is shaping up to be the superhero cross-over we've been waiting for. Each hero plays like they are the star of their own title and the combat feels perfectly balanced - it's clear thought went into how each hero should feel.  We're excited to delve further into their individual stories and curious to see how customization and multiplayer will further flesh out the experience. Best superhero games: what to play while waiting for Marvel's Avengers to assemble.</p>
