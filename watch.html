		<h2>THE GAMEPLAY</h2>
		<hr />
		<p>With so many NPCs with so many different talents, you can approach missions in various ways. On a mission to rescue a potential ally from a torture site hidden at a construction site, I used Mary, my construction worker. I just waltzed in the front door, set transformers and industrial batteries to send out non-lethal, but incapacitating shots to Albion goons and made my way to the designated area. By the time, anyone was the wiser that the hostage was free, we were halfway out the site while the enemy was getting zapped left and right.  Gunplay is relatively tight and is comparable to other Ubisoft titles such as Far Cry New Dawn or The Division 2. If you get spotted during a sneaking mission or if you’re just a run-and-gun type, I definitely suggest trying to get headshot whenever you can. The guns I had during the demo are somewhat weak, making it easy to be overwhelmed in a short time if you don’t stay on the move.</p>

		<p>One place where Ubisoft has tightened things up is the driving. Operating a vehicle in the previous title was a floaty unintuitive experience. But getting behind the wheel in Legion revealed tighter, more natural feeling controls. I could feel my car pulling as I took a turn too fast and I could feel the acceleration and deceleration as made my way through traffic. Honestly, the biggest problem I had was driving on the other side of the road. But if you want even more control of your vehicle, Ubisoft has a whole menu that will let you tweak vehicle settings.  The hacking aspects of the game are similar to the previous games as you can use your device to hack into phones, drones, vehicles, servers and city infrastructure. So if you’re in a high-speed chase, you can raise or lower columns in the street to create or remove potential roadblocks. I quickly discovered that I could control cars and buses, making them turn, back up or accelerate forward at will. And of course, when you’re infiltrating enemy spaces, you can hack into electrical conduits, creating a booby trap or disable patrolling drones. It’s still a fun wrinkle to the tried-and-true sneaking mission that I continue to enjoy. </p>

		<h2>THE WORLD</h2>
		<hr />
		<p>If you’ve played any modern Ubisoft game over the past decade, you know that the company is serious about its realism. To that effect, the sprawling metropolis of London has been faithfully reproduced in all its glory. That means it’s absolutely massive, which is perfect for an open-world title. The streets are bustling with life as NPCs go about their business, just waiting to be recruited to DedSec’s ranks. </p>
		<img src="gamingpic/watchdog/dog4.jpg" width="1000" height="550" title="Watch Dog" alt="Watch Dog">
		<p>You’ll find famous London landmarks like the Palace of Westminster, Big Ben and London Bridge. It’s fun to grab a scooter and sightsee or if you’re in a hurry grab a car or take the Tube to get to your destination. I didn’t run through nearly as many missions as the game offers, but I’m hoping that this building diversity carries over to the interior. Too often in these types of games, you find yourself playing through the same layout with only minor tweaks to shake things up. And with all open-world games, I’m hoping that the missions don’t get too repetitive. Depending on the title and gameplay, the thrill gets old way too fast and you’re trudging along to get to the end of the game. </p>

		<h2>MULTIPLAYER WILL RETURN IN Watch Dogs Legion</h2>
		<hr />
		<p>Ubisoft hasn't shared any details on Watch Dogs Legion's multiplayer, but it did describe the singleplayer experience as the "springboard" into multiplayer.</p>
		<img src="gamingpic/watchdog/dog1.jpg" width="1000" height="550" title="Watch Dog" alt="Watch Dog">
		<h2>EARLY VERDICT</h2>
		<hr />
		<p>An ambitious premise that is far more simplistic than it seems, Watch Dogs Legion is a repetitive game with scant surprises.</p>
